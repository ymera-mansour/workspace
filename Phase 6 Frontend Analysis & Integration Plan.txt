- Data migration plans and timelines
- Risk management and rollback strategies
- Monitoring and validation processes
- Communication plans

**Migration Approach**:
- API-first integration with fallback mechanisms
- Feature flagging for controlled rollout
- Backward compatibility maintenance
- Comprehensive data integrity measures

## Key Insights

### Frontend Maturity
The existing frontend is a sophisticated React application with:
- Modern technology stack (React 19, Tailwind CSS, Three.js)
- Rich UI/UX with advanced visualizations
- Good performance considerations (lazy loading, virtualization)
- Comprehensive feature set covering all required functionality

### Integration Opportunities
Significant opportunities exist to enhance the application through:
- Real API integration replacing mock data
- JWT-based authentication improving security
- WebSocket connectivity enabling real-time updates
- Performance optimizations leveraging backend services

### Risk Areas
Several areas require careful attention during migration:
- State management standardization (mixed Redux/Zustand)
- Data migration from mock to real backend
- Performance optimization during API transitions
- User adoption of new authentication flows

## Recommendations for Next Phase

### Immediate Actions
1. **Team Alignment**: Review all documentation with development team
2. **Environment Setup**: Configure development environments with new API endpoints
3. **API Contract Validation**: Confirm backend endpoints match specifications
4. **Task Prioritization**: Begin implementation of Phase 1 (Foundation Setup)

### Short-term Focus
