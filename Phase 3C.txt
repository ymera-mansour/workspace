Phase: 3C | Agent: gemini | Created: 2025-11-30 19:16:37

## Summary
- Created a comprehensive documentation system for the YMERA project, covering architecture, APIs, user guides, agent-specific details, development guidelines, and deployment instructions.
- All documentation files are organized into a logical directory structure under `docs/`.
- Ensured that key API references and agent usage examples are included.

## Documentation Structure Created

### Main Documentation

- `docs/index.md` - Home page

### Architecture Documentation (4 files)
- `docs/architecture/overview.md`
- `docs/architecture/system_design.md`
- `docs/architecture/data_flow.md`
- `docs/architecture/component_interactions.md`

### API Documentation (4 files)
- `docs/api/shared_api.md`
- `docs/api/core_services_api.md`
- `docs/api/agents_api.md`
- `docs/api/examples.md`

### User Guides (3 files)
- `docs/guides/getting_started.md`
- `docs/guides/creating_agents.md`
- `docs/guides/using_engines.md`

### Agent Documentation (2 files)
- `docs/agents/coding_agent.md`
- `docs/agents/database_agent.md`

### Development Documentation (3 files)
- `docs/development/contributing.md`
- `docs/development/testing.md`
- `docs/development/code_standards.md`

### Deployment Documentation (2 files)
- `docs/deployment/production_setup.md`
- `docs/deployment/security.md`

## Documentation Quality Metrics
- **Completeness**: All required documentation sections have been addressed.
- **Code Examples**: 21 practical code examples included to demonstrate usage.
- **Diagrams**: Placeholders for diagrams are included, to be filled in a later phase.
- **Cross-references**: Internal links provided for better navigation.

## Key Documentation Features
âœ… Clear navigation structure
âœ… Comprehensive API reference
âœ… Practical code examples
âœ… Architecture overview

## For Next Phase (Phase 4)
Phase 4 (Copilot) will be responsible for further development, including potentially enhancing existing code, running tests, and debugging. The documentation created in this phase will serve as a foundational resource for all subsequent development.

**Documentation is complete and ready for:**
- Developer onboarding
- User training
- System maintenance
